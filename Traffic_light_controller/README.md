# Traffic_light_controller
Self Project

This project focuses on designing a traffic light controller (TLC) using Verilog HDL on Xilinx 14.5 FPGA. The system aims to optimize traffic flow at a T-shaped road intersection by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. The system efficiently manages traffic lights and pedestrian signals using Finite State Machine (FSM) principles.
